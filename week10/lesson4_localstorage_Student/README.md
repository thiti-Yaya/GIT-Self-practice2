# Lesson 4: Client-Side Storage

Make your quotes persistent using the browser's `localStorage`. You will store the quotes so they don't disappear when the page is refreshed.

## Objectives

Starter Code must include:

- `saveQuotes()` — Save the current list of quotes to `localStorage`
- `loadQuotes()` — Load quotes from `localStorage` into the app
- Ensure all quote operations (add, edit, delete) update both the array and `localStorage`
- Ensure `renderQuotes()` is called after loading or modifying data

## Expected Behavior

- Quotes persist after refreshing the browser
- Any added, edited, or deleted quotes remain consistent between sessions
